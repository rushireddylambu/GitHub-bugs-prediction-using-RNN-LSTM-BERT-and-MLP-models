# GitHub-bugs-prediction-using-RNN-LSTM-BERT-and-MLP-models

• Developed a pipeline to classify GitHub issues into bugs, features, and questions using deep learning.

• Preprocessed 150,000 issues with title and body data, balancing classes and vectorizing text with TF-IDF.

• Trained various models, including RNN, LSTM, BERT, and MLP, achieving the highest accuracy of 69% with
the MLP model.

• Automated issue categorization, reducing manual effort and improving scalability.
